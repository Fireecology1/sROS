Modify Chapman-Richards function for horizontal asymptote

Modification Strategy:

Instead of having 100 as the upper limit, we replace it with a function that grows linearly:
y=(a+bx)×(1−e^(−cx))d


where:

    a+bx defines the oblique asymptote (so in your case, a=0, b=0.3).
    c controls how fast the curve approaches the asymptote.
    d still controls the steepness of the sigmoidal transition.

Specific Equation for y=0.3xy=0.3x as the asymptote:
y=(0.3x)×(1−e(−0.444x))3

This keeps the original sigmoidal shape but ensures that as x→∞, y≈0.3x.

Would you like finer control over the transition? For example, adjusting how quickly it moves from the exponential phase to following the linear asymptote?
